# entain-tech-task

React native app utilising the Neds API, technical task for Entain by Liam Di Dato.

### Setup
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start`
- In a seperate terminal/cmd, run `yarn android` or `yarn ios`

Note this was only tested on Android as I do not own a personal Mac or iPhone.
However, I didnt use any platform specific code, so theres no reason it shouldnt run perfectly fine on iOS.
